## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- There are currently 240,124 active employees at Pewlett Hackard. The percentage of employees retiring is approximately 14%. In order to successfully absorb such a huge number of retirees you will need to hire at least 16,559 people or half of the amount retiring. 
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? 
- Of each department there is an average of approximately 15% of employees retiring. Additionally of each department there is an average of 0.7% of mentors available to train the next generation. Based on these numbers I would recommend that managment expand their mentor criteria to capture at minimum 2% of employees per department whom are eligible to be mentors.
